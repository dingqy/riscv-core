The signal ram/Inst_DDR/u_ddr_mig/u_ddr2_infrastructure/pll_clk3_out on the ram/Inst_DDR/u_ddr_mig/u_ddr2_infrastructure/plle2_i/CLKOUT3 pin of ram/Inst_DDR/u_ddr_mig/u_ddr2_infrastructure/plle2_i does not drive the same kind of BUFFER load as the other CLKOUT pins. Routing from the different buffer types will not be phase aligned.
